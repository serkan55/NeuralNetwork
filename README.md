# NeuralNetwork Project

This project provides a simple machine learning framework inspired by scikit-learn, focused on educational use and experimentation. It includes custom implementations of a neural network and a decision tree classifier, designed for tasks such as image classification with the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **SimpleNeuralNetwork**: A basic feedforward neural network for classification tasks.
- **CustomDecisionTreeClassifier**: A decision tree classifier using weighted layers and forward propagation.
- **MNIST Example**: End-to-end workflow for training and evaluating models on the MNIST dataset.
- **Easy Integration**: Modular code for quick experimentation and learning.

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
2. Train the neural network to obtain weights.
3. Use the decision tree classifier for predictions and accuracy evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for MNIST dataset loading)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `custom_sklearn_test.py` to see a full example of training and evaluating the models.
