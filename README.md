# NeuralNetwork
The custom_sklearn module provides simple machine learning models inspired by scikit-learn, including a neural network and a decision tree classifier. It enables training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation, and is ideal for educational use and basic experiments, such as MNIST image classification.
